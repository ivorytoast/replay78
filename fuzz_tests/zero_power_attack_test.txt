# Zero Power Attack Test
# Tests that cells with 0 power cannot attack or move
# Only power-ups (same-cell moves) should be allowed

# Setup: Create a scenario with 0-power cells
ttt|move|0 0 0 0
ttt|move|0 1 0 1
ttt|move|1 0 1 0
ttt|move|1 1 1 1

# Both players now have cells with power 1
# X attacks O, creating a draw (both go to power 0)
ttt|move|1 0 1 1

# Now cell (1,0) has X with power 0, cell (1,1) has O with power 0
# It's now O's turn. Try to attack with the 0-power O cell - should be REJECTED
ttt|move|1 1 1 0

# Try to move the 0-power O cell - should be REJECTED
ttt|move|1 1 0 2

# Power-up same cell should still work (costs power bank)
